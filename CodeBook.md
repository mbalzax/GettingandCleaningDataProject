## Transformations

### Applied to the original Data sets 
1. Merge the training and the test sets
2. Select the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Asign descriptive activity names (activity labels) to name the activities in the data set
4. Asign labels to the variable columns (feature names).
5. Write a new data set with the average of each variable for each activity and subject.
